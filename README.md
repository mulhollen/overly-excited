# overly-excited


1. Create an addExcitement function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.

2. Then add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

3. Add logic in the addExcitement function to the increase the number of exclamation points after every third word. The number of exclamation points (!) will be determined by how many times the counter variable can be divided by 3.

4. Add a new argument to the function so that a developer can specify which character should be displayed instead of it always being an exclamation point.

5. Now you should define another variable that will hold an array of different words than your existing sentence. Perhaps name the variable betterSentence, or nextSentence.

6. Watch the video about arrow functions, and see if you can rewrite addExcitement using that syntax
